## About Carisma
Carisma is a dynamic mobile app that allows car enthusiasts to capture, share, and discover photos and videos of unique cars spotted in everyday life. Whether itâ€™s a rare classic, an exotic sports car, or a customised masterpiece, Carisma gives users an easy and interactive platform to document the vehicles they encounter. The app fosters a passionate community of car lovers, encouraging users to share their car sightings, interact with fellow enthusiasts, and explore the wide world of automotive culture, all from the convenience of their phones. 

Designed for users aged 13 and older, Carisma enables anyone to create an account by registering with their email and choosing a username. Once signed up, users can upload their car sightings, tagging them with relevant details and sharing them with followers or a specific group of car lovers. Carisma also allows users to like and comment, promoting engagement and building a sense of community. Whether discovering rare vehicles or connecting with likeminded enthusiasts, Carisma is the perfect app for anyone eager to immerse themselves in the world of cars.

## Why We Built This App
Carisma was created to provide a space where car enthusiasts can easily connect, share and most importantly discover the cars that really spark their passion. For too long, car fans have been posting photos of amazing vehicles to their social media stories, only to receive a handful of likes or comments from people that confused a Toyota GR86 with a Subaru BRZ. These interactions left enthusiasts without a platform to truly share their excitement with likeminded individuals.

We built Carisma to fill this gap by offering a platform where you can share your excitement with others who truly appreciate it. Our goal is to build a vibrant and constantly growing community of car lovers.
